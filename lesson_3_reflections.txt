1.) When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keep all 
    the work local?
     Having a remote repository would be better for collaboration.  It 
     gives you somewhere everyone can get to and you have a backup of
     your project.  So if your computer has a mishap you will not 
     lose data.

 2.) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
     automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
      You could introduce changes that are from another developer.  But, they 
      are not compatible with what you have on your machine.  It is better to 
      pull when you are ready.  Maybe you have all the things you want in your
      code committed so that if you accidentally overwrite something you can 
      return to an unmodified state.
