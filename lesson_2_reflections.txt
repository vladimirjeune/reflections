1.) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
     When you initialize a repository you create a .git folder that holds the
     metadata about your git repo.  This is necessary so that you can have all
     the information that you get when you run git log/status/etc...  It is
     also probably needed for showing the correct file state when you change
     from one commit to a previous one.

 2.) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
 	 repository? What value do you think it offers?
 	  The working directory is really just the directory on your computer.
 	  Though the the contents that you asked not to see may not appear.  
 	  The staging directory is where you will put things that you want in 
 	  your next commit.  This will be a subset of the working directory 
 	  with files of your choosing present.  This allows you to put files 
 	  together in commits that are idealogically similar.  This will make it
 	  easier to look through your commits when you do git log.
